        <h1>Zakaat ( charity )</h1>

        <p><strong>Zakaat</strong> is a fundamental pillar of Islam, representing a mandatory form of charity. It is an act of worship through which Muslims purify their wealth and help those in need. The word "Zakaat" in Arabic means purification and growth. By giving a portion of one’s wealth, a Muslim purifies the rest and contributes to the betterment of society.</p>
        <p>Zakaat is obligatory on every adult Muslim who meets the nisab threshold — the minimum amount of wealth one must possess before Zakaat becomes due. The rate is usually 2.5% of savings and assets held for a full lunar year. It is not taken from necessities like food, clothes, home, or daily earnings, but rather from surplus wealth such as gold, silver, business goods, and savings.</p>
        <p>The primary goal of Zakaat is to assist the poor, the needy, and other eligible categories mentioned in the Qur'an (Surah At-Tawbah, 9:60). It aims to reduce inequality, strengthen community bonds, and ensure economic balance. Zakaat is not just a donation; it is a right of the poor upon the wealth of the rich.</p>
        <p>Unlike voluntary charity (Sadaqah), Zakaat is a compulsory duty. Ignoring or delaying it is considered sinful. It is both a spiritual act and a social responsibility — a way to gain Allah’s blessings, purify the soul from greed, and promote compassion within the ummah (Muslim community).</p>
        <p>Thus, Zakaat is a powerful tool in Islam that combines faith with social justice.</p>
