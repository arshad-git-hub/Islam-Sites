        <h1>Roza ( Ramadan )</h1>

        <p><strong>Ramadan</strong> is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar and is considered the holiest month for Muslims worldwide. It commemorates the first revelation of the Qur'an to the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, making it a deeply spiritual and significant time in Islam. Muslims believe that during this month, the gates of Heaven are opened, the gates of Hell are closed, and the devils are chained.</p>
        <p>Fasting during Ramadan, known as Sawm, is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, which are the core beliefs and practices in the religion. From dawn to sunset, Muslims abstain from food, drink, smoking, and marital relations. The fast begins with a pre-dawn meal called Suhoor and ends with a sunset meal known as Iftar.</p>
        <p>The purpose of fasting is not only physical abstinence but also spiritual purification. It teaches self-discipline, gratitude, and empathy for the less fortunate. Muslims spend more time in prayer, reading the Qur'an, and performing good deeds during this month.</p>
        <p>Special nightly prayers called Taraweeh are held in mosques, and the last ten nights of Ramadan are especially sacred, as they include Laylat al-Qadr (the Night of Power), which is believed to be better than a thousand months.</p>
        <p>Ramadan ends with the celebration of Eid al-Fitr, a joyous festival marked by communal prayers, feasting, charity (Zakat al-Fitr), and social gatherings.</p>
        <p>Ramadan is not just about fasting—it is a time of renewal of faith, increased worship, and community connection.</p>
